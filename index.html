          I said to the gym instructor: ‘Can you teach me to do the splits?’ He
          said: ‘How flexible are you?’ I said: ‘I can’t make Tuesdays.'

          I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger eating a chocolate egg. I said: ‘I bet I
          know what your favourite Christian festival is.’ He said: ‘You have to

          it comes out.

          I never got along with my dad. Kids used to come up to me and say, "My
          dad can beat up your dad." I'd say "Yeah? When?"

          I used to be in a band called ‘Missing Cat’… you probably saw our
          posters.

          I was going to join the debating team, but somebody talked me out of

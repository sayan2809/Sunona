          I said to the gym instructor: ‘Can you teach me to do the splits?’ He
          said: ‘How flexible are you?’ I said: ‘I can’t make Tuesdays.'
        </p>
        <p>I’ve decided to sell my Hoover – it was just collecting dust.</p>
        <p>
          I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger eating a chocolate egg. I said: ‘I bet I
          know what your favourite Christian festival is.’ He said: ‘You have to
          love Easter, baby.'
        </p>
        <p>
          I was reading a book – ‘The History of Glue’ – I couldn’t put it down.

          I need my sleep. I need about eight hours a day, and about ten at
          night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't mean to sound bitter, cold, or cruel, but I am, so that's how
          it comes out.

          I never got along with my dad. Kids used to come up to me and say, "My
          dad can beat up your dad." I'd say "Yeah? When?"

        <p>There’s a fine line between hyphenated words.</p>
        <p>
          I used to be in a band called ‘Missing Cat’… you probably saw our
          posters.
        </p>
        <p>Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations?</p>
        <p>
          I was going to join the debating team, but somebody talked me out of
          it.
